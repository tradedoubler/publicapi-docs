# Tradedoubler Advertiser Management API

Tradedoubler is an Affiliate Marketing Network, connecting various advertising brands with our network of publishing websites. Tradedoubler's platform manages this relationship between advertisers and publishers. 
This documentation relates to the Advertiser API, which allows brands or advertisers to manage their programs on Tradedoubler's platform. 

Changelog
=========

Endpoints changed in this release:
+ GET /events
+ POST /events
+ PUT /events

### Events
When creating a lead or sale event, we automatically create a corresponding impression based event (i.e. for when there is no click we assign the conversion to an impression and then track using the referencing impression conversion event).
We have added the referencing iLead or iSales event to leads and sales event.

## Authentication
Authentication against the API is handled by [oAuth 2.0](https://oauth.net/2/) using bearer tokens. Once you have authentication using the oauth endpoint, all requests require a bearer token sent via the `Authorization` header as per the following format:
```
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.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.cN_ose-fMtxGbVN27Yg2Sotc4zz4oLLVkyZHvCvj0zs
```

You will need a valid Client ID and Secret code before you can use the API. 
You will need to retrieve this through the [Tradedoubler API Client UI](https://solutions.tradedoubler.com/tools/api-client).
For more information see [oAuth Section](#/reference/o-auth-2-0)

## Response Formats
The reponse format for all API requests is JSON. All requests should therefore contain the following header:
```
Content-Type: application/json
```

Rate Limiting
================
To ensure system stability we apply limits to the number of API requests allowed by API Clients. This is limited to 60 requests per minute. If you exceed this you will receive the a HTTP 429 Too Many Requests Status Error with the response body: 
```
API rate limit exceeded
```
Please wait another minute and you will be able to make API requests again.

Paging
======
To handle large results and to optimise performance of our API we use paginatation on a number of our endpoints to reduce the size of results returned to the client. All endpoints supporting pagination will return 2 attributes:
- offset
- limit

To page through the results you need to supply two fields within the body of your GET request:

|Paramater|Description|Details|
|:--------|-----------|-------|
offset|Offset the results by a specified amount|Integer, default is 0|
limit|Limit the number of results to be returned|Integer, default is 20, maxmium limit is 100 unless specified

For example: 
- If the limit is default at 20 and an endpoint produces 100 results, only the first 20 will be returned (results 0 to 19). 
- In order to retrieve the remaining results, use the offset parameter. In this example, adding offset=20 to the query string parameters.
- Results begin at offset 0. If you're retrieving a report with limit=20, page 2 will begin at offset=20, page 3 at offset=40, page 4 at offset=60, etc.

Roles
=====
Advertiser users can be given one of four roles. This determines which endpoints they can access.

# Group oAuth 2.0

## Bearer and Refresh Token [/uaa/oauth/token]
Tradedoubler APIs use oAuth2 authentification with refreshTokens.
All requests must be validated with a bearerToken in the header request.

Only use oAuth2 credentials when you don't already have a refresh token!

### Client Credentials

To use our APIs you will need to create a client which provides a ClientId and ClientSecret. 
The client is required to generate a bearer token which is used on all subsequent API requests to validate your account and role. 
You can create your API client using our tool at the following URL: https://solutions.tradedoubler.com/tools/api-client

Your clientSecret is only shown once when you create a new client. 
If you do not know your clientSecret you must delete and recreate the client in the [API Client UI](https://solutions.tradedoubler.com/tools/api-client)!

<img width="125%" src="https://hst.tradedoubler.com/file/47446/api_client_screenshot.jpg"/></br>

### Bearer token [POST]
To generate a bearer token you need to send a POST request to the oauth endpoint with your username and password. 
All requests have to be signed with an Authorization generated by a valid ClientID and ClientSecret in the Header:
```
Authorization: Basic U3dhZ3dsciByb2Nrcw== 
```
Where `U3dhZ3dsciByb2Nrcw==` is Base64 encoding of ClientID and ClientSecret
`base64encoded(ClientID:ClientSecret)`

#Group Pending Sales
## Pending Sales [/advertiser/pendingSales]
In Tradedoubler transactions can be given a pending status whereby an advertiser has a set amount of time to validate a pending sale (usually up to 90 days) and approve/deny the transaction. This is usually to allow for an advertiser's returns or cancellation policy. Being able to approve a transaction in Tradedoubler as soon as it is confirmed in an advertiser's system provides greater transparency to your publishers around when they will be paid for their activities.

### Validate transactions [PUT]
Validate transactions by changing the status to approved or denied. For transactions that are denied we require a reasonId to give the publisher greater transparency as to why the transaction was denied. (@Nick add reason codes). It is possible to modify the order value for a transactions to reflect a partial return/cancellation, this can also be done without updating the transaction status - i.e. the transaction will remain in a pending state.
